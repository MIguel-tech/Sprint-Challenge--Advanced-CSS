1. What is the difference between an adaptive website and a fully responsive website?
An adaptive website adapts itself to fit into various screen sizes. 
It relies on predefined screen sizes to adapt itself to resolutions across devices.

2. Describe what it means to be mobile first vs desktop first.
Mobile first means the developer begins designing for the mobile device first and 
then adds features for the larger screen desktop version.
Desktop first means the developer begins designing for the desktop first and 
then removes or rearranges features for the smaller screen mobile version.

3. What does `font-size: 62.5%` in the `html` tag do for us when using `rem` units?
Font size 62.5% in HTML makes it easy for the developer to convert to rems by
making everything 10 based. For example 16px would be 1.6rem.

4. How would you describe preprocessing to someone new to CSS?
Preprocessing is a more robust form of CSS written in a different language.
It gives the developer not only more tools in the tool box but also more powerful tools for developing.

5. What is your favorite concept in preprocessing? What is the concept that gives you the most trouble?
My favorite concept in preprocessing is the use of variables.
I like that variables make it so easy to change one thing across multiple pages so quickly.
The things that are giving me trouble are the mixins 
and how to add animation to my page but i will learn these eventually on my own.
